# ORLY

Run commands as root.

## Use

```
$ orly command [arg...]
```

The `command` is mandatory.

## Install

Run

```
$ make install
```

to install `orly` in `$HOME/bin`.

## But why?

I saw [this comment](https://lobste.rs/s/ldkfdg/sudon_t#c_dsa5kx) on a
lobste.rs story about an old program called `really` that runs commands as
other users that called it "UNIX performance art" and got interested in seeing
how it worked.
The core of it is basically this program.

## Should I use this?

Oh no.
